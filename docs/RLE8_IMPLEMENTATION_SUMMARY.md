# RLE8 Implementation Summary

## What was Fixed

### 1. Missing RLE8 Decompression Function
- **Issue**: The `_read_compressed_sprite_data_v2` function only logged that RLE8 was not implemented
- **Fix**: Implemented proper RLE8 decompression algorithm based on MUGEN SFF v2 specification

### 2. Missing Sprite Metadata Storage
- **Issue**: Width, height, format, and other sprite metadata were not stored in the SFFSprite class
- **Fix**: Extended SFFSprite class to store all necessary SFF v2 metadata fields

### 3. RLE8 Algorithm Implementation
- **Implementation**: Based on MUGEN SFF v2 specification:
  - Control byte = 0: Literal run (next byte = count, followed by literal bytes)
  - Control byte > 0: RLE run (control byte = count, next byte = value to repeat)

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive validation for sprite data bounds
- Improved texture creation and caching for RLE8 decompressed sprites
- Better error messages for debugging

## Key Functions Added/Modified

### New Functions:
- `_read_rle8_sprite_data_v2()`: Handles RLE8 sprite decompression and texture creation
- `_decompress_rle8()`: Core RLE8 decompression algorithm

### Modified Functions:
- `_read_compressed_sprite_data_v2()`: Now properly routes RLE8 format to the new handler
- `_parse_sff_v2()`: Enhanced to store sprite metadata needed for decompression
- `SFFSprite` class: Extended with width, height, format, color_depth, and data_offset fields

## Test Results Expected

With these fixes, Guile and other SFF v2 characters with RLE8 compressed sprites should now:
1. ✅ Load without parsing errors
2. ✅ Display sprites correctly (not just colored placeholders)
3. ✅ Provide proper sprite textures for the character selection and battle systems
4. ✅ Handle thousands of sprites efficiently

## Files Modified
- `scripts/mugen/sff_parser.gd` - Core RLE8 implementation
- `scripts/test/guile_comprehensive_test.gd` - Comprehensive test suite
- `tools/test_rle8_algorithm.py` - Algorithm validation

## Next Steps
1. Test with Guile SFF file to verify RLE8 decompression works
2. Test with other SFF v2 characters (Ryu, Ken, etc.)
3. Implement RLE5 and LZ5 if needed for additional character support
4. Optimize performance for large sprite sets
