# Main Menu Restructure - Fighter Manager

## ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Solved**
The `main_menu.tscn` scene was incorrectly using the MUGEN menu script, making it function as a MUGEN fighting game menu instead of a proper Fighter Manager main menu.

## âœ… **Changes Made**

### **main_menu.tscn Scene Restructure:**
- **Changed Script**: Now uses `main_menu_ui.gd` (proper Fighter Manager menu)
- **New Layout**: Professional main menu with Fighter Manager branding
- **Menu Options**:
  - New Career (start management career)
  - Load Career (continue existing career)
  - Battle Viewer (view/analyze fights)
  - MUGEN Fighting Menu (access MUGEN arcade modes)
  - Character Test (debug character loading)
  - Settings
  - Exit Game

### **Navigation Flow:**
```
main_menu.tscn (Fighter Manager Main Menu)
â”œâ”€â”€ New Career â†’ [Career Creation] (TODO)
â”œâ”€â”€ Load Career â†’ [Save Browser] (TODO)
â”œâ”€â”€ Battle Viewer â†’ battle_viewer.tscn
â”œâ”€â”€ MUGEN Fighting Menu â†’ mugen_main_menu.tscn
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Arcade Mode
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ VS Mode  
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Training Mode
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Back to Main â†’ main_menu.tscn
â”œâ”€â”€ Character Test â†’ [Character Debug]
â”œâ”€â”€ Settings â†’ [Settings UI] (TODO)
â””â”€â”€ Exit Game
```

### **Code Changes:**
1. **main_menu.tscn**: 
   - Updated to use `main_menu_ui.gd` script
   - Added proper Fighter Manager UI layout
   - Added MUGEN Menu button for fighting modes

2. **main_menu_ui.gd**:
   - Added MUGEN menu navigation function
   - Connected new button signal

3. **mugen_main_menu.gd**:
   - Changed exit behavior to return to Fighter Manager main menu
   - Updated exit button text to "BACK TO MAIN"

## ðŸŽ® **Game Structure Clarification**

### **Fighter Manager (Management Game)**
- **Main Scene**: `main_menu.tscn` 
- **Purpose**: Career mode, fighter management, tournaments
- **Style**: Modern UI for management features

### **MUGEN (Fighting Game)**  
- **Scene**: `mugen_main_menu.tscn`
- **Purpose**: Arcade, VS, Training fighting modes
- **Style**: Authentic MUGEN look with system.def graphics
- **Uses**: Our improved SFF parser for authentic sprite display

## ðŸš€ **Benefits**
- Clear separation between management and fighting game modes
- Proper Fighter Manager branding and navigation
- Access to MUGEN fighting modes when desired
- Return navigation from MUGEN back to main menu
- SFF parser improvements apply to MUGEN graphics

The game now has a proper main menu structure that reflects its dual nature as both a fighter management simulation and an authentic MUGEN fighting game experience.
