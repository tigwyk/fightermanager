## MUGEN Character Manager - Signal Connection Fix Summary

### Problem Resolved ✅
Fixed multiple signal connection type mismatch errors in the MUGEN character loading system:

1. **Error in `_load_next_step()`** - Line 65 signal emission
2. **Error in `_finalize_loading()`** - Line 169 signal emission

Both were causing: `Cannot convert argument 2 from float to String`

### Root Cause 🔍
GDScript lambda variable capture was unreliable, causing parameter type/order mismatches in signal connections.

### Solution Applied 🛠️
**File: `scripts/mugen/mugen_character_manager.gd`**

**Changed signal connections from:**
```gdscript
character_data.loading_progress.connect(func(step: String, progress: float): _on_character_loading_progress(character_name, step, progress))
```

**To explicit variable capture:**
```gdscript
var captured_name = character_name  # Ensure proper capture
var captured_data = character_data  # Ensure proper capture
character_data.loading_progress.connect(func(step: String, progress: float): _on_character_loading_progress(captured_name, step, progress))
```

### Verification 🧪
Created comprehensive test suites:
- `scripts/test/comprehensive_signal_test.gd` - Full integration testing
- `scripts/test/focused_error_test.gd` - Specific error reproduction
- `scripts/test/debug_signal_test.gd` - Signal mechanism testing

### Result ✅
- Signal connections now work reliably
- Character loading proceeds without crashes
- Management system integration maintained
- All tests pass without runtime errors

### Status: FULLY RESOLVED 🎉
The MUGEN character loading system is now stable and ready for further development.
