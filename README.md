## 📚 Usage Examples

### **Loading a Character**
```gdscript
# Through MugenSystem autoload
var character = MugenSystem.load_character("res://assets/mugen/chars/ryu")
if character:
    var info = character.get_character_info()
    print("Loaded: %s by %s" % [info.display_name, info.author])
```

### **Running a Battle Simulation**
```gdscript
var simulator = BattleSimulator.new()
var fighter1 = {"name": "Ryu", "stats": {"power": 100, "defense": 90, "speed": 85}}
var fighter2 = {"name": "Chun-Li", "stats": {"power": 85, "defense": 95, "speed": 100}}

simulator.start_battle(fighter1, fighter2)
var result = await simulator.auto_simulate_battle()
print("Winner: %s" % result.winner)
```

### **Getting Sprite Data**
```gdscript
var character = MugenSystem.load_character("path/to/character")
var portrait = character.get_portrait_sprite()  # Group 9000, Image 0
var stance = character.get_stance_sprite()      # Group 0, Image 0
```
